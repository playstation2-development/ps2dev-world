CD Version of the PS2Dev BP demo 2k4.

Ok well it's finally here, an .iso of the BP Demo.

Few notes,

1) This is not designed for Neo2 chips or anything like that. It probably doesn't work on any
swapping method or shit like that. Deal with it and get a half-decent mod chip. I guess it 
probably won't work in a debug PS2 as I only used Nero to build the disc not some warezed Sony
tool.

2) This only runs in PAL mode. It was designed that way, in NTSC mode it banz0rs so I removed it.
If your PS2/TV doesn't support PAL then you are outta luck :)

3) I have used the latest freesd so hopefully it will work on old .jp PS2's, at least in PAL video
mode :P

Anyway enjoy it, or not it's your choice.
